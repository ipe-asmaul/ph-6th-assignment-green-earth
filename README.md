## (1) Ans:
<b> Var :</b> Var is function scoped and can be redeclared, can't be used before initialization <br>
<b> Let :</b> Let is block-scoped meaning if decalared inside a function or if etc block can't be used in outside and it value can be changed. <br>
<b> Const :</b> Const is method of variable declaring variable which is block scoped and it data cannot be changed after assigning one

## (2)Ans:

<b> map() :</b> Return an array from an array by taking specific expression or logic. For exmaple if we have a array of objects containg name and age and by using map() method we can easily return an array of only names or age.<br>
<b> forEach() :</b> Iterate over every single element of array and by passing expression different kind of things can be done and it doesn't return any array <br>
<b> filter() :</b> Return an array. Filter() method accept expression and filter out an array consits of elements that satisfy the given expression<br>

## (3)Ans:

<b> Arrow Function :</b> It is a new method of writting functions introduced in ES6. Here we no longer need to write the function keyword and can easily store a function into a variable and also can call it by variable(). It can also implicitly return values. Example: let add = (a,b) => a+b <br>

## (4)Ans:

<b>Destructuring :</b> Destructuring is method where we can store array elements or object values in more efficient and readable way. Example: const [a,b,c] = array; Here the variable a b c contains the elements of array of index 0 1 2; 
for Object we need to define the name of the variable by the key name of object which we want to fetch value. 
const {name, age} = object1; Here object1 have keys naming same as the variables
<br>

## (5)Ans: 

<b>Template literals :</b> Template literals are introduced in ES6 and it is a new method of defining string. Using it we can write multiline string and also using this we can perform a concatination operation without the plus sign. We just need to cover the variable name by ${variableName}. sign to be used as template literals is `` .Example: const variable = `Hello, ${name}` where name is a variable name. This how we can write variables with string as much as we need.
